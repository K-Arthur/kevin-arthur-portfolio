## üìù Content Management

This project is designed for easy content updates without needing to modify the React components.

### Personal Info, Skills, Experience, and Education

All personal and professional data is managed in a single file:

-   **File Path:** `src/data/portfolio-data.js`

### Work Portfolio Projects

The work portfolio is generated dynamically. To add or manage projects, follow these steps:

1.  **Add Project Assets:**
    -   Create a new folder inside `public/images/work/`.
    -   The folder name should match the project name exactly as it will appear in the categories file (e.g., `My Awesome Project`).
    -   Place all images and videos for the project inside this new folder.
    -   The first image found will automatically be used as the thumbnail.

2.  **Assign to a Category:**
    -   Open the `src/data/categories.json` file.
    -   Add the exact project name (matching the folder name) to the `"projects"` array of the desired category (e.g., `"UI/UX Design"` or `"Graphic Design & Branding"`).

### Case Studies

Case studies are written in MDX, allowing you to use Markdown and custom components.

1.  **Create a file:** Add a new `.mdx` file in the `content/case-studies/` directory.
2.  **Add frontmatter:** Include the title, publication date, and a brief summary at the top of the file.

### Professional Headshot

To update your headshot on the "About" page, replace the file at `public/placeholder-headshot.png` with your photo. Keep the filename the same.

## üé® Customization

### Theme & Colors

The color palette for both light and dark modes is defined using CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css`. You can modify these variables to change the site's color scheme.

Look for the `:root` and `.dark` selectors to adjust the color scheme to your liking.

### 3D Scene

The immersive 3D sphere on the homepage can be customized.

-   **File Path:** `src/components/Scene.js`

You can change the object's color, distortion, speed, and other properties within the `AnimatedSphere` component.
