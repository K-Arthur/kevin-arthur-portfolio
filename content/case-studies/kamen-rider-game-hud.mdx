As a lifelong fan of Kamen Rider—and someone who's spent way too many hours absorbing the visual grammar of transformation sequences, suit designs, and the glorious chaos of tokusatsu action—this project was a dream playground. But beyond the "geeking out," this was a serious design exercise: **How do you make a HUD that feels as visually explosive as a Rider Kick, but remains 100% readable when the player has 0ms to react?**

This case study walks through the visual language, UX principles, and Figma component system I developed for a conceptual action game interface.

## The Challenge

### The Paradox of "Controlled Chaos"

Tokusatsu (Japanese special effects shows like Kamen Rider, Super Sentai, and Ultraman) are defined by **sensory overload**: explosions, glowing effects, rapid transformations, dramatic camera angles. Fans *love* this. It's part of the DNA.

But in a game, that same energy can kill the player—literally. If the health bar is obscured by a cool glitch effect, the player dies. If the combo meter is too subtle, the player loses momentum.

> *"Every UI element in active combat is competing for the same 200ms of player attention. You have to earn the right to be loud."*

The design goal was clear:
- **Feel** chaotic and energized (honor the genre).
- **Be** ruthlessly clear and accessible (serve the player).

## The Visual Language

### Color Palette: Neon-Tech on Void Black

The palette is intentionally limited but high-impact. Every color has a job.

The key insight was that on a dark (`#0A0A0A`) background, colors like Impact Orange (`#FF6B35`) and Rider Teal (`#00C9B7`) naturally pop at **WCAG AA/AAA levels** for text. This lets me be visually aggressive without sacrificing accessibility.

### Typography: Sharp, Condensed, and Urgent

For UI text, I selected **Rajdhani** and **Orbitron**—semi-condensed, geometric sans-serifs that evoke a technological, slightly "industrial" feeling. These fonts are:
- **Highly legible** at small sizes (critical for HUD elements).
- **Aesthetically aligned** with the sci-fi/tokusatsu genre.
- **Freely available** (important for a conceptual project that could be shared).

Display text and titles use **Bebas Neue** and custom "glitched" treatments to add that sense of volatile energy.

### The "Glitched-Industrial" Aesthetic

The visual motifs are pulled directly from what I love about Kamen Rider suit designs: the blend of organic curves and hard-edged technology. In UI terms, this translates to:
- **Circuit-like patterns** running through backgrounds and dividers.
- **Holographic textures** on panels and overlays.
- **Subtle "glitch" effects** on hover states—scanlines, RGB shift, noise grain.

This final point is crucial: the glitch effect is **never applied to critical information by default**. It's a decorative layer that appears on hover or in non-critical states. This ensures that a player who needs to see their health bar sees a clear, solid color—not a seizure-inducing lightshow.

## Player-First UX: The Guiding Principles

This wasn't just about making things "look cool." Every design decision was filtered through a set of player-first UX principles, particularly around **cognitive load** and **accessibility**.

## Design System: The Figma Component Library

To ensure consistency and scalability, I built a modular component system in Figma:

### Button Components
- **Primary Action** (Impact Orange fill, used for "Start Game," "Confirm")
- **Secondary Action** (Outlined Rider Teal, used for "Back," "Options")
- **Destructive Action** (Crimson Glow, used for "Delete Save," "Exit")
- All buttons include defined `:hover`, `:focus`, and `:disabled` states with appropriate contrast.

### HUD Elements
- **Health Bar:** Segmented design with clear "low health" color shift (green → yellow → red/pulsing).
- **Energy Meter:** A secondary resource bar with a distinct visual profile (Rider Teal, vertical).
- **Combo Counter:** A large, central number that scales up with consecutive hits, then fades gracefully.

### Menu Frames
- **Glass-Morph Panels:** Semi-transparent backgrounds with strong neon borders.
- **Consistent Padding:** 24px minimum padding, 48px minimum touch targets for interactive elements.
- **Clear Focus States:** A glowing neon outline that's impossible to miss.

## The "Reduce Motion" Consideration

A significant portion of the visual identity relies on animation—glitches, pulses, and glows. For players who have "reduce motion" enabled in their OS settings (or a hypothetical in-game accessibility menu), the design gracefully degrades:

- All glitch effects become static, high-contrast borders.
- Pulsing glows become solid colors.
- Transition animations are replaced with instant state changes.

This was baked into the thinking from the start, not bolted on as an afterthought.

## Key Takeaways

1.  **Aesthetic and Accessibility are not mutually exclusive.** A dark theme with neon accents is naturally high-contrast. Lean into it.
2.  **Design for the worst-case scenario.** If the UI is clear when the player is panicking, it's clear all the time.
3.  **Decorative effects should be opt-in, not mandatory.** Put the "cool stuff" on hover states and in non-critical contexts.
4.  **Build accessibility into your design system, not into individual screens.** If the component is accessible, every instance of it is accessible.

This project was a passion piece, but it sharpened my thinking on how to balance brand identity with user needs. The principles here—especially around cognitive load—apply just as well to a fintech dashboard as they do to a Kamen Rider game.
