Minohealth AI Labs is at the forefront of AI healthcare innovation in Africa. As their work gained international recognition, they needed a dedicated platform to share their research, company updates, and thought leadership. The existing website lacked a structured space for long-form content, making it difficult to communicate complex scientific findings to a diverse audience ranging from investors to healthcare providers. I was tasked with designing a blog that would serve as the digital voice of the lab, balancing scientific rigor with accessibility.

## The Tension

### The Content Challenge
**Bridging the gap between academic paper and blog post.**
The content needed to be rigorous enough for peer review but accessible enough for the general public.
- **Scientific papers** are dense, text-heavy, and intimidating.
- **Marketing blogs** can feel too fluffy and lack substance.
- **The specific challenge**: How to design a reading experience that honors the depth of the research while remaining engaging and easy to read?

*Complex technical features and applications needed to be presented clearly within the blog content flow.*

### Business Goals
1.  **Establish Authority**: Position Minohealth as a thought leader in the African AI space.
2.  **Improve Readability**: creating a distraction-free environment for consuming long-form content.
3.  **Scalability**: Design a system that can grow with the lab's increasing publication output.

## Research & Discovery

### Analyzing the Landscape
I audited several research-heavy blogs (OpenAI, DeepMind, Google AI) to understand industry standards.
*   **DeepMind**: Uses rich visuals and clean typography to break up dense text.
*   **OpenAI**: Very minimalist, ensuring nothing detracts from the research itself.

### User Needs
For our target audience—researchers, potential employees, and partners—content *is* the product.
-   **Researchers**: Want to quickly scan headers and abstract-like summaries.
-   **General Public**: Need clear categorization to distinguish between "News" and "Hard Science."

## Design Solution

### 1. The "Paper-Like" Aesthetic
I chose a warm, off-white background (`FAF5EA`) paired with dark gray text to mimic the feeling of reading a physical journal or paper. This reduces eye strain, which is critical for long-form technical reading.

**Typography Choices:**
-   **Headings**: Bold, expressive sans-serif fonts in the brand's primary magenta accent. This adds energy without compromising readability.
-   **Body**: A clean, high x-height sans-serif (Inter) optimized for screen reading at various sizes.

### 2. Distraction-Free Reading Layout
The single-column layout for individual posts ensures the reader's focus remains entirely on the content.
-   **No Sidebar Clutter**: Avoiding "trending posts" or ads in the peripheral vision.
-   **Generous Whitespace**: Giving complex diagrams and code snippets room to breathe.

*The reading experience focuses on clarity, with ample whitespace and carefully selected typography.*

### 3. Clear Categorization System
I implemented a robust tagging system prominently displayed above article titles (e.g., RESEARCH, NEWS, COMPANY).
-   **Visual Scanning**: Users can immediately identify the *type* of content before clicking.
-   **Color Coding**: Subtle use of color to differentiate categories.

### 4. Responsive & Accessible
Given the diverse internet conditions across the target African markets, the design prioritized performance and mobile accessibility.
-   **Fast Loading**: Minimized heavy assets on the index page.
-   **Readable on Mobile**: Font sizes and line heights were carefully tuned for smaller screens.

*The blog index features a vertical list layout with clear category tags and preview snippets, allowing users to quickly scan for topics of interest.*

*Mobile menu and navigation design ensuring easy access to categories on smaller screens.*

![Dark Mode Support](https://res.cloudinary.com/dov1tv077/image/upload/v1752155975/New_Blog_Details_Dark_Mode_mcdwov.png)
*Full dark mode support ensures comfortable reading in low-light environments, a critical accessibility feature.*

## Conclusion

The Minohealth AI Labs blog now stands as a central repository for the company's knowledge. By focusing on typography, reading comfort, and clear organization, the design successfully bridges the gap between high-level scientific research and public accessibility. It empowers the team to own their narrative and share their innovations with the world in a format that feels both professional and inviting.
