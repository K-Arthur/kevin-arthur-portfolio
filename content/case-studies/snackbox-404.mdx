Transformed SnackBox's 404 error page into an engaging brand moment that reduced bounce rates by 32% and increased search usage by 45%. This 1-week design sprint focused on creating a delightful error experience that aligns with SnackBox's fun, candy-inspired brand identity.

## Problem & Goals

### Pain Point
- 23% of users encountering 404 pages were leaving the site immediately
- Generic error page didn't reflect SnackBox's fun, candy-inspired brand
- No clear path to continue shopping or find desired products
  
### Business Goals
1. Reduce bounce rate from 404s by 20%
2. Increase engagement with key site features (search, categories)
3. Reinforce brand personality through playful, on-brand error handling
4. Improve overall user experience during error states

## Research & Insights

### User Behavior Analysis
- Heatmaps showed users scrolling past generic error messages
- Session recordings revealed confusion when landing on 404 pages
- 68% of users didn't use the browser's back button
  
### Competitive Analysis
- Reviewed error pages from top e-commerce and subscription services
- Identified patterns in successful 404 designs (search bars, popular links)
- Noted opportunities for brand differentiation

### Analytics & User Testing
- 7% of site exits originated from 404s
- Most common source: outdated newsletter links
- Test participants felt blank-slate 404s were "jarring" and "uninspiring"
- 80% expected navigation aids (home link, search)

> **Key Takeaway:** A 404 can feel like a dead end—or a micro-moment to surprise and delight.

## Design Process

### Ideation & Wireframes

1.  **Moodboard:** Bright candy photography, bold typography, simple iconography
2.  **Content Brainstorm:**
    -   Candy face "reaction" image
    -   Clear "Go Back" button
    -   Secondary links: "Shop Bestsellers," "Search"
3.  **Low-Fi Sketches:**
    -   Layout variations: image on left vs full-bleed
    -   Yellow background to match brand palette

### Visual Design & Interaction

- **Final Comps:**
  - **Image:** Gummy candies arranged into a surprised "face"
  - **404 Treatment:** Oversized "4" characters in white with hot-pink drop-shadows; the "0" replaced by a candy bowl
  - **CTA Button:** Outlined hot-pink "GO BACK →" with hover animation
  - **Typography:** Bold sans-serif; all-caps for CTAs, sentence case for body text

- **Micro-interaction (GIF):**
  - Gentle bounce on the candy-face
  - Button pulse on load

### Usability Testing & Iteration

- **Prototype Test (10 users):**
  - 9/10 immediately noticed the "Go Back" button
  - 7/10 smiled or commented on the candy face—"nice touch!"
- **Tweaks:**
  - Enlarged button hit-area on mobile
  - Added drop-shadow under candy bowl for depth
  - Animation runs only once to avoid distraction
