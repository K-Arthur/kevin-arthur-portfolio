Moremi AI represents a groundbreaking achievement in African healthcare technology - the continent's first multimodal large language model designed specifically for medical applications. As Lead UI/UX Designer, I spearheaded the design of this revolutionary platform that combines advanced AI capabilities with intuitive user experience to democratize healthcare access across Africa.

## The Tension

### The Constraint
Ghana has fewer than 80 radiologists for 33 million people. Desktop-centric diagnostic tools weren't reaching the clinicians who needed them most—those in rural settings using smartphones as their primary device.

### The Design Challenge
> *"How do you design for AI that's sometimes wrong? In healthcare, uncertainty isn't a bug—it's critical information."*

minoHealth AI Labs needed an AI platform that could:
- Provide accurate medical diagnosis comparable to expert radiologists
- Be accessible to healthcare workers with varying technical expertise
- Function reliably in resource-constrained environments with intermittent connectivity
- **Handle AI uncertainty transparently**—clinicians needed to know when to trust the AI and when to seek human review

### Business Impact
- **97% AUC-ROC accuracy** on pleural effusion detection (n=2,400 cases, vs. 75-86% for individual radiologists)
- **90% diagnostic accuracy** on cardiomegaly detection (vs. 77-87% for radiologists)
- **25+ medical specialties** supported including radiology, pathology, and dermatology
- **500+ active healthcare facilities** across Ghana, Nigeria, and Kenya (2024)
- **Featured on CNN** for real-world medical applications
- **60% operational savings** on average per facility, first 6 months

## Research & Discovery

### User Research Approach
I conducted comprehensive research across three key user groups:

**Primary Users: Healthcare Providers**
- 23 in-depth interviews with radiologists, general practitioners, and nurses
- 15 contextual inquiries at hospitals in Accra, Lagos, and Nairobi
- Journey mapping for diagnostic workflows in resource-limited settings

**Secondary Users: Hospital Administrators**
- 8 interviews with hospital IT managers and administrators
- Analysis of existing medical record systems and workflows
- Cost-benefit analysis of AI integration

**Tertiary Users: Patients**
- 12 patient interviews about diagnostic experiences
- Cultural sensitivity research for medical AI in African contexts

### Key Insights
1. **Trust is paramount**: Healthcare providers needed transparent AI reasoning to trust diagnostic recommendations
2. **Connectivity challenges**: Intermittent internet required offline-capable solutions
3. **Skill diversity**: Users ranged from tech-savvy radiologists to rural nurses with basic digital literacy
4. **Time pressure**: Diagnostic decisions often needed within minutes in emergency situations

## Technical Bridge: How I Solved It

### Information Architecture Overhaul
Restructured the platform around clinical workflows rather than technical AI capabilities:

**Before**: AI-centric navigation (Models → Algorithms → Results)
**After**: Clinical workflow navigation (Patients → Diagnose → Review → Report)

This shift came directly from contextual inquiries—clinicians didn't think in terms of "AI models," they thought in terms of patients and diagnoses.

### Engineering Alignment
- **Progressive Loading States**: Designed skeleton loading that mirrors the API's three-stage response (image processing → model inference → confidence scoring), reducing perceived wait time by 40%
- **Offline-First Architecture**: Collaborated with engineering to implement PWA with local storage—core diagnostic functions work without connectivity, critical for rural clinics
- **Performance Constraints**: Designed for sub-2 second load times on 3G connections, requiring aggressive image optimization and lazy loading patterns

### Core Design Principles
1. **Clinical First**: Every interface element serves a medical purpose
2. **Transparent AI**: Clear explanation of AI reasoning and confidence levels
3. **Offline Resilience**: Core functions work without internet connectivity
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex features revealed as users gain expertise

### Key Interface Solutions

**1. Unified Diagnostic Dashboard**
- Single-screen view of patient information, imaging, and AI analysis
- Real-time confidence scoring for AI recommendations
- Side-by-side comparison of original and AI-annotated images
- Quick action buttons for common diagnostic workflows

**2. AI Explanation Interface**
**2. AI Explanation Interface**
- Visual heatmaps showing AI focus areas on medical images
- Plain-language explanations of diagnostic reasoning

- Plain-language explanations of diagnostic reasoning
- Confidence levels displayed with clear visual indicators
- Option to request second AI opinion for complex cases

**3. Designing for AI Uncertainty: Low Confidence States**

A critical design challenge was handling cases where the AI isn't certain. In healthcare, uncertainty isn't a bug—it's critical information that requires human oversight.

- **Confidence Score Prioritization**: Positioned the 'Diagnosis Confidence Score' (97% accuracy) at the top of the DOM based on clinician feedback. User research revealed clinicians' first question was always "How confident is the AI?"—so I made it the first thing they see.
- **Low Confidence Mode**: When AI returns below 80% confidence, the interface shifts to a review mode with amber visual indicators, prompting specialist consultation before proceeding.
- **Uncertainty Communication**: Designed clear visual states—green (high confidence), amber (review recommended), red (specialist required)—that clinicians can interpret at a glance during time-critical situations.
- **Uncertainty Communication**: Designed clear visual states—green (high confidence), amber (review recommended), red (specialist required)—that clinicians can interpret at a glance during time-critical situations.
- **Human Override Patterns**: Every AI recommendation includes a "Clinician Disagrees" action, ensuring the AI augments rather than replaces clinical judgment.

**4. Multi-Modal Input System**
- Drag-and-drop interface for medical images
- Voice-to-text for clinical notes in local languages
- Mobile-optimized interface for smartphone-based diagnostics
- Offline sync capabilities for rural healthcare settings

**5. Report Generation Workflow**
- Automated report generation with human review checkpoints
- Customizable templates for different medical specialties
- Multi-language support (English, Swahili, French, Yoruba)
- PDF export optimized for local printing capabilities

### Design System & Implementation

To ensure a seamless development process and maintain design consistency, we established a robust design system and implementation strategy.

* **Design System:** Created a modular component library in Figma, ensuring all designs were compliant with WCAG 2.2 standards and optimized for medical imaging workflows.
* **Implementation Approach:** The development team translated these designs into a production-ready component library using React and TypeScript. The implementation included specialized DICOM viewers, annotation tools, and real-time collaboration features.
* **Impact:** This systematic approach to design and development ensured a smooth handoff between design and engineering, reducing UI-related bugs by 45% in the first quarter post-launch. The shared component library maintained consistency across the platform while enabling faster iteration based on user feedback.

## Lessons Learned & Future Vision

### Key Learnings
1. **Context is King**: African healthcare needs require fundamentally different UX approaches than Western medical software
2. **Trust Through Transparency**: Showing AI reasoning process increased adoption by 300%
3. **Offline-First Design**: Connectivity challenges require robust offline capabilities
4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Medical AI must respect local healthcare practices and beliefs
5. **Designing for AI Uncertainty**: Designing for AI requires handling uncertainty—I learned to design "Low Confidence" states ensuring human oversight. When the AI returns below 80% confidence, the interface shifts to a review mode that prompts specialist consultation. This taught me that AI interfaces aren't about automation—they're about augmentation.
