Moremi Collaborate represents a significant evolution in telemedicine collaboration, building upon MinoHealth AI Labs' proven expertise in AI-powered radiology solutions. This generative AI-powered platform transforms how medical professionals work together by creating a connected environment that reflects the collaborative nature of modern healthcare. Building on MinoHealth's success in developing AI systems that outperform radiologists by 10% in diagnostic accuracy (as published in their clinical evaluation study), Moremi Collaborate integrates seamlessly with their existing medical AI chat application to enable project-based collaboration, peer review systems, and monetized expertise sharing. As Lead Product Designer, I spearheaded the creation of this innovative platform that empowers medical professionals to work more efficiently, share insights seamlessly, and collaborate on patient cases and reports directly within the telemedicine environment.

## The Tension

### The Systems Challenge
**Creating consistency across chat, file sharing, and report generation**—three fundamentally different interaction patterns that needed to feel like one unified platform.

### The Scale Problem
MinoHealth's AI chat application was successful but fragmented:
- **87% of clinicians** used 3+ different platforms for remote collaboration
- Each new feature meant redesigning from scratch
- Design-to-dev handoff was causing 45% of UI bugs
- No systematic approach to component reuse

> *"How do you unify chat, file sharing, and AI-generated reports into a cohesive experience without overwhelming clinicians already managing complex cases?"*

### Business Goals
1. Transform the existing medical AI chat into a collaborative platform
2. Create organized, shareable workspaces for medical professionals
3. Establish a peer review ecosystem that ensures quality and generates revenue
4. Build a modular design system that accelerates future development

## Research & Discovery: Understanding Telemedicine Collaboration Needs

### Stakeholder Interviews
Conducted in-depth interviews with 25+ healthcare professionals including:
- Radiologists and imaging specialists
- General practitioners and specialists
- Hospital administrators
- Telemedicine coordinators

### Key Insights
- **87% of clinicians** reported using 3+ different platforms for remote collaboration
- **Medical imaging review** was identified as the highest-priority use case, aligning with MinoHealth's core expertise in AI-powered radiology
- **Project tracking** was consistently mentioned as a major pain point
- **AI assistance** was desired but needed to maintain clinical oversight, particularly important given the sensitive nature of medical imaging diagnosis

> **Critical Discovery:** Healthcare professionals wanted AI to augment, not replace, their clinical judgment while providing seamless collaboration tools. This insight was particularly valuable given MinoHealth's research showing AI systems can achieve 10% higher diagnostic accuracy than individual radiologists.

### Competitive Analysis
Analyzed existing telemedicine platforms and identified gaps in:
- AI-powered medical imaging analysis
- Integrated project management workflows
- Real-time collaborative review capabilities
- Cross-platform communication tools
