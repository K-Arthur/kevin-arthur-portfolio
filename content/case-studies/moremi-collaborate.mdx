Moremi Collaborate represents a significant evolution in telemedicine collaboration, building upon MinoHealth AI Labs' proven expertise in AI-powered radiology solutions. This generative AI-powered platform transforms how medical professionals work together by creating a connected environment that reflects the collaborative nature of modern healthcare. Building on MinoHealth's success in developing AI systems that outperform radiologists by 10% in diagnostic accuracy (as published in their clinical evaluation study), Moremi Collaborate integrates seamlessly with their existing medical AI chat application to enable project-based collaboration, peer review systems, and monetized expertise sharing. As Lead Product Designer, I spearheaded the creation of this innovative platform that empowers medical professionals to work more efficiently, share insights seamlessly, and collaborate on patient cases and reports directly within the telemedicine environment.

## Problem & Context

### The Healthcare Collaboration Challenge

Healthcare professionals face significant barriers when collaborating remotely on patient cases. Traditional telemedicine solutions lack the sophisticated project management and AI-powered insights needed for complex medical decision-making.

### Key Pain Points
- **Fragmented Workflow:** Medical professionals struggled with organizing multiple patient interactions, reports, and discussions across different systems
- **Inefficient Report Management:** Clinicians had to search through individual chat histories to find medical reports, making retrieval time-consuming
- **Limited Collaboration:** No seamless way to share complex cases, seek second opinions, or collaborate on patient reports within the AI platform
- **Monetization Barriers:** Experienced medical professionals lacked opportunities to leverage their expertise for additional income through peer review
- **Quality Assurance Gaps:** Limited mechanisms for systematic peer review and quality control of AI-generated medical reports

### Business Goals
1. Transform the existing medical AI chat application into a collaborative platform
2. Create organized, shareable workspaces for medical professionals
3. Establish a peer review ecosystem that ensures quality and generates revenue
4. Build a community of medical experts contributing to better healthcare outcomes
5. Monetize expertise through an approved reviewer program

## Research & Discovery: Understanding Telemedicine Collaboration Needs

### Stakeholder Interviews
Conducted in-depth interviews with 25+ healthcare professionals including:
- Radiologists and imaging specialists
- General practitioners and specialists
- Hospital administrators
- Telemedicine coordinators

### Key Insights
- **87% of clinicians** reported using 3+ different platforms for remote collaboration
- **Medical imaging review** was identified as the highest-priority use case, aligning with MinoHealth's core expertise in AI-powered radiology
- **Project tracking** was consistently mentioned as a major pain point
- **AI assistance** was desired but needed to maintain clinical oversight, particularly important given the sensitive nature of medical imaging diagnosis

> **Critical Discovery:** Healthcare professionals wanted AI to augment, not replace, their clinical judgment while providing seamless collaboration tools. This insight was particularly valuable given MinoHealth's research showing AI systems can achieve 10% higher diagnostic accuracy than individual radiologists.

### Competitive Analysis
Analyzed existing telemedicine platforms and identified gaps in:
- AI-powered medical imaging analysis
- Integrated project management workflows
- Real-time collaborative review capabilities
- Cross-platform communication tools
